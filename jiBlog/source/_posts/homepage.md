## Welcome to my homepage! :zzz:

This is my first post to this blog website! :yum:
It is really exciting for me to have the chance to really say something on the Internet.
There are mainly **:three:** reasons for me to start the blog.

* :star: **Reading others' blog really inspires me**
  * Others' sharing experiences on blogs really helps me through many mind-windling :scream: situations, and I really want to be one of them. Hopefully my experience will help the readers as well :smile:
<br/>

* :point_up: **Learning without recording is not as effective**
  * This came across to my mind when I am taking 6.S081: Operating System Engineering (great course btw). There are so many important details and great minds inside an O/S, which I think should be well-learned and recorded.
<br/>

* :collision: **SHARING IS ALWAYS FUN!**
  * The thrill of sharing takes up the most part of why I am starting this blog! Not only sharing the experience is rewarding :yum:, but sharing my daily life is also exciting.
<br/>

**To everyone read this page:**

*May the force be with you*
